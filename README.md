Solar Power Generation Prediction Using Machine Learning
my project is to find the solar output using linear regression

OBJECTIVE:The goal of this project is to analyze solar power generation data and build a machine learning model to predict power output (kW) based on environmental and system factors.
The main steps involved are:
1.Load the Data
2.Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
3.Data Visualization & Correlation Analysis
4.Model Training (Random Forest Regressor)
5.Model Evaluation
WHY SHOULD WE DO THIS PROJECT?
This project is important because it helps in predicting solar power generation, which has direct applications in energy management, grid optimization, and sustainability efforts. 
✔ Reduces costs and improves energy efficiency.
✔ Promotes sustainability & clean energy adoption
